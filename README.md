As we can see in this plot, the average sales per store is $4.3. There is almost no difference between the three stores, as prices remain nearly the same. The reason behind this is that people often buy the most popular product in each store, leading to similar pricing trends. We will further explore this in the next plot.

2. Product Sales

Analyzing product sales, we see that the most popular product in each store is coffee, with total sales amounting to $269,952. Coffee plays a major role in consumer habits due to the widespread coffee culture, which helps people refresh their energy and enhance their mood.

The least popular product is packaged chocolate, with sales of only $4,408. This lower demand can be attributed to factors such as dietary preferences and availability in supermarkets. Additionally, packaged chocolate does not pair as well with coffee compared to baked goods.

The popularity ranking of products:

Coffee: $269,952

Tea: (second highest, amount not specified)

Bakery items: $82,316

Packaged chocolate: $4,408

Analyzing sales patterns throughout the day is crucial for coffee shops and stores.

The peak sales period is between 8 AM and 10 AM, when most people are heading to work. During these three hours, sales account for 35% of total daily sales.

The least sales occur at 6 AM and 8 PM.

This information helps owners determine optimal staffing levels and efficient business hours.

The monthly sales data indicates:

The highest sales months are May and June, exceeding $300,000.

The lowest sales month is February, with only $16,359.

Lower winter sales are due to:

Reduced foot traffic as people prefer traveling by car or taxi.

Decreased tourism during this time.

Recommendations for Business Improvement

1. Product Strategy

✅ Prioritize high-selling items: Expand coffee and tea varieties, introduce premium options, and offer seasonal or limited-time flavors.
✅ Enhance bakery selection: Consider fresh, artisanal, or healthy bakery options to complement coffee and tea.
✅ Reevaluate packaged chocolate: Reduce stock or promote it through discounts, bundle deals, or strategic placement near checkout counters.

2. Seasonal Promotions

✅ Leverage May and June sales surges: Launch targeted marketing campaigns, special discounts, and loyalty programs during peak months.
✅ Offer summer-inspired beverages (iced coffee, flavored tea, etc.) to match seasonal preferences.

3. Operational Efficiency

✅ Optimize staffing during peak hours (8-10 AM): Ensure enough employees are available for fast service and efficient handling of rush hours.
✅ Adjust business hours if necessary: If low sales at 6 AM and 8 PM persist, consider reducing hours or introducing late-evening promotions (e.g., discounts on bakery items).

4. Customer Engagement & Upselling

✅ Introduce breakfast meal combos (coffee + bakery) to boost morning sales.
✅ Encourage loyalty programs and mobile ordering to attract repeat customers and streamline peak-hour operations.

By implementing these strategies, the coffee shop can enhance customer satisfaction, maximize revenue, and optimize business operations.
